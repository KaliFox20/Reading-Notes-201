### Flexbox/CSS Layout

Flexbox: Flexbox is a layout mechanism designed for laying out groups of items in one dimension. Learn how to use it in this module.
Flexbox features: 
- They can display as a row, or a column.
- They respect the writing mode of the document.
- They are single line by default, but can be asked to wrap onto multiple lines.
- Items in the layout can be visually reordered, away from their order in the DOM.
- Space can be distributed inside the items, so they become bigger and smaller according to the space available in their parent.
- Space can be distributed around the items and flex lines in a wrapped layout, using the Box Alignment properties.
- The items themselves can be aligned on the cross axis.

Flexbox Directions: 
- row: the items lay out as a row.
- row-reverse: the items lay out as a row from the end of the flex container.
- column: the items lay out as a column.
- column-reverse : the items lay out as a column from the end of the flex container.

Flexbox Spacing: 
- flex-grow: 0: items do not grow.
- flex-shrink: 1: items can shrink smaller than their flex-basis.
- flex-basis: auto: items have a base size of auto.

Flexbox Alignment: 
- justify-content: space distribution on the main axis.
- align-content: space distribution on the cross axis.
- place-content: a shorthand for setting both of the above properties.
- align-self: aligns a single item on the cross axis
- align-items: aligns all of the items as a group on the cross axis
