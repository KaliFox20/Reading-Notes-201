## CSS Layout

*Normal Flow*: Elements on webpages lay themselves out according to normal flow - until we do something to change that. This article explains the basics of normal flow as a grounding for learning how to change it.
*Flexbox*: Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces. 
*Grids*: CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns, and has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward.
*Floats*: The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow.
*Positioning*: Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal document layout flow and make them behave differently, for example, by sitting on top of one another, or by always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport.

## Learn JS

*Functions*: allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short command â€” rather than having to type out the same code multiple times.
*Invoke*: It mean when you excute the function
*Parameters*: these are values that need to be included inside the function parentheses, which it needs to do its job properly.
